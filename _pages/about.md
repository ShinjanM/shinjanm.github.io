Hello, I am Shinjan Mandal. A computational condensed matter physicist from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore working with [Prof Manish Jain](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~mjain/member/mjain/).

My current research focuses on studying electron-phonon interactions in bilayers of twisted 2D systems and computing the transport coefficients in these systems.
