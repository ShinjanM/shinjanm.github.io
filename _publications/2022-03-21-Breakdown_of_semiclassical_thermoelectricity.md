The planar assembly of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) hosts multitude of interaction-driven phases when the relative rotation is close to the magic angle $(\theta_m = 1.1^{\circ})$. This includes correlation-induced ground states that reveal spontaneous symmetry breaking at low temperature, as well as possibility of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) excitations. 
However, experimentally, manifestation of NFL effects in transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene remains ambiguous. 
Here we report simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity $(\rho)$ and thermoelectric power $(S)$ in tBLG for several twist angles between $\theta \sim 1.0^{\circ} − 1.7^{\circ}$. 
We observe an emergent violation of the semiclassical Mott relation in the form of excess $S$ close to half-filling for $\theta \sim 1.6^{\circ}$ that vanishes for $\theta \geq 2^{\circ}$. The excess $S (\simeq 2 \mu V/K$) at low temperatures $(T \sim 10 K at \theta \simeq 1.6^{\circ})$ persists upto $\simeq 40 K$ , and is accompanied by metallic T-linear $\rho$ with transport scattering rate $(\tau^{−1})$ of near-Planckian magnitude $\tau^{-1} \sim kBT/\hbar$. 
Closer to $\theta_m$, the excess $S$ was also observed for fractional band filling $(\nu \simeq 0.5)$. The combination of non-trivial electrical transport and violation of Mott relation provides compelling evidence of NFL physics intrinsic to tBLG.
